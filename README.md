# FunnyEncryption
A funny encryption ‘algorithm’ and its demo pages.

Enc/Dec source files are in the folder Haskell.

The default name of the complied executable file should be encdec and it is must be added to the $PATH. Because the JavaScripts in demo pages directly invoke ’encdec’.

It is host on port 8084.
